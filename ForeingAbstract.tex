Golumbic, Lipshteyn and Stern defined in 2009 the class of EPG graphs, an intersection graph class  based on edge intersection of paths on a grid. An EPG graph $G$ is a graph that admits a representation where its vertices correspond to paths in a grid $Q$, such that two vertices of $G$ are adjacent if and only if their corresponding paths in $Q$ have a common edge. If the paths in the representation have at most $k$ changes of direction  (bends), we say that this is a  $B_k$-EPG representation. A collection $C$ of sets satisfies the Helly property when every sub-collection of $C$ that is pairwise intersecting has at least a common element. In this work we prove that  $B_k$-EPG graph class and $B_k$-EPG-Helly graph class do not always coincide, we prove that every graph has a $B_k$-EPG-Helly representation and we study the problem of $B_1$-EPG graph recognition whose path-intersection on the grid satisfies the Helly property. In addition, we also present some classes of graphs for which the results can be extended.

%In this paper we show that the problem of recognizing $B_1$-EPG graphs whose edge-intersections of paths in a grid satisfy the Helly property is NP-complete. Moreover, the $NP$-completeness extends to 2-apex and 3-degenerate graphs.


Keywords: Edge-intersection of paths on a grid, Helly property, Intersection graphs, $NP$-completeness, Single bend paths.
